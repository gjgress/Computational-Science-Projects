\section{A script to build a LaTeX document while hiding auxiliary files}
\lstset{language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Content of shell script to compile LaTex documents}]
#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p .build

pdflatex -output-directory="./.build" $1
mv ./.build/$1.pdf ./
\end{lstlisting}
If the user runs the shell script with the extension of the LaTeX file, say, project.tex, then the shell script will append a ".tex" to the end of this, resorting in the file not being found. If the file is not in the directory of the shell script, and the user attempts to give the full path to the file, this will also result in an error, as the shell script assumes the file is in the current directory.\\

Finally, if the folder the shell script is in does not have user write permissions, the script may fail, as in that case it would require superuser permissions.
